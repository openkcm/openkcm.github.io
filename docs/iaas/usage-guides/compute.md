# Compute Resources

OpenKCM compute resources are `Machines`, their associated `Machineclasses` and `MachinePools` that allow you to define, provision, and manage virtual machines. This guide explains the core compute resource types and how to use them.

## Machine

A `Machine` resource in OpenKCM is used to represent a compute resource or a virtual machine. It serves as a means to 
configure network, storage, type of machine and other information needed to create a compute instance.

### Example Machine Resource

An example of how to define a Machine resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: compute.OpenKCM.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Machine
metadata:
  name: machine-sample
spec:
  machineClassRef:
    name: machineclass-sample
  image: my-image
  volumes:
    - name: rootdisk # first disk is the root disk
      volumeRef:
        name: my-volume
  networkInterfaces:
    - name: primary
      networkInterfaceRef:
        name: networkinterface-sample
  ignitionRef:
    name: my-ignition-secret
```

**Key Fields**:

- `machineClassRef` (`string`): Is a reference to the `MachineClass` of the machine.
- `machinePoolRef` (`string`): Defines the `MachinePool` to run the `Machine` on. If empty, the OpenKCM scheduler will figure out an appropriate pool to run the `Machine` on.
- `image` (`string`): Image is the optional URL providing the operating system image to memory boot the `Machine`. A detailed description of OS images can be found in the corresponding [section](/iaas/architecture/os-images).
- `volumes` (`list`): Are list of `Volumes` attached to this machine. Here the first volume is considered as the root disk. Each volume is defined with a name and a reference to the `Volume` resource.
- `networkInterfaces` (`list`): Define a list of network interfaces present on the machine.
- `ignitionRef` (`string`): Is a reference to a `Secret` containing the ignition YAML for the machine to boot up. If the `key` value is empty, the `DefaultIgnitionKey=ignition` will be used as a fallback.

- [Machine with non ephemeral resources](https://github.com/openkcm/OpenKCM/tree/main/config/samples/e2e/machine-with-non-ephemeral-resources)

## MachineClass

A `MachineClass` is an OpenKCM resource used to represent a class/flavor of a `Machine`. It serves as a means to 
define the number of resources a `Machine` object can have as capabilities (e.g. CPU, memory) associated with a particular class. 

### Example MachineClass Resource

An example of how to define a `MachineClass` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: compute.OpenKCM.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MachineClass
metadata:
  name: machineclass-sample
capabilities:
  cpu: 4
  memory: 16Gi
```

**Key Fields**:

- `capabilities` (`ResourceList`): Capabilities are used to define a list of resources a Machine can have, along with its capacity.

## MachinePool

A `MachinePool` is a resource in OpenKCM that represents a pool of compute resources managed collectively. It defines 
the infrastructure's compute configuration used to provision and manage `Machines`, ensuring resource availability and 
compatibility with associated `MachineClasses`.
 
> Note:One `machinepoollet` is responsible for one `MachinePool`.

Details on how `MachinePools` are announced and used can be found in the [Pools and Poollets](/iaas/architecture/scheduling) section.

### Example MachinePool Resource

An example of how to define a MachinePool resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: compute.OpenKCM.dev/v1alpha1
kind: MachinePool
metadata:
  name: machinepool-sample
spec:
  providerID: OpenKCM://shared
```

**Key Fields**:

- `providerID` (`string`): The `providerId` helps the controller identify and communicate with the correct compute system within the specific backend compute provider.
