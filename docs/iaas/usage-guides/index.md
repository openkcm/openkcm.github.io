# Usage Guides

This section provides usage guides for the OpenKCM IaaS layer, covering how to work with key resources such as
`Machine`, `Volume`, and `Network`. It also includes information on scheduling, resource management, and lifecycle
operations. Those guides are intended to give the user a comprehensive understanding of OpenKCM IaaS resources.

More examples and detailed usage can be found in the [end to end examples](https://github.com/openkcm/OpenKCM/tree/main/config/samples/e2e)
