# Cloud Controller Manager (IaaS)

[Cloud-Controller-Manager](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller) (CCM) is the bridge 
between Kubernetes and a cloud-provider. CCM is responsible for managing cloud-specific infrastructure resources such 
as `Routes`, `LoadBalancer` and `Instances`. CCM uses the cloud-provider (OpenKCM in this case) APIs to manage these 
resources. We have implemented the [cloud provider interface](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider/blob/master/cloud.go)
in the [`cloud-provider-OpenKCM`](https://github.com/openkcm/cloud-provider-OpenKCM) repository. 
Here's a more detail on how these APIs are implemented in the OpenKCM IaaS cloud-provider for different objects.

## Node lifecycle

The Node Controller within the CCM ensures that the Kubernetes cluster has an up-to-date view of the available `Nodes` 
and their status, by interacting with cloud-provider's API. This allows Kubernetes to manage workloads effectively and 
leverage cloud provider resources. 

Below is the detailed explanation on how APIs are implemented by `cloud-provider-OpenKCM` for `Node` instance.

### Instance Exists

- `InstanceExists` method checks for the node existence. `Machine` object from OpenKCM represents the `Node` instance.

### Instance Shutdown

- `InstanceShutdown` checks if the node instance is in shutdown state

### Instance Metadata

InstanceMetadata returns metadata of a node instance, which includes :

- `ProviderID`: Provider is combination of ProviderName(Which is nothing but set to `OpenKCM`)
- `InstanceType`: InstanceType is set to referencing MachineClass name by the instance.
- `NodeAddresses`: Node addresses are calculated from the IP information available from NetworkInterfaces of the machine.
- `Zone`: Zone is set to referenced MachinePool name.


## Load balancing for Services of type LoadBalancer

`LoadBalancer` service allows external access to Kubernetes services within a cluster, ensuring traffic is distributed 
effectively. Within the CCM there is a controller that listens for `Service` objects of type `LoadBalancer`. It then 
interacts with cloud provider specific APIs to provision, configure, and manage the load balancer. Below is the detailed
explanation on how APIs are implemented in OpenKCM cloud-provider.

### GetLoadBalancerName

- `GetLoadBalancerName` return LoadBalancer's name based on the service name

### Ensure LoadBalancer

- `EnsureLoadBalancer` gets the LoadBalancer name based on service name.
- Checks if OpenKCM `LoadBalancer` object already exists. If not it gets the `port` and `protocol`, `ipFamily` information from the service and creates a new LoadBalancer object in the OpenKCM. 
- Newly created LoadBalancer will be associated with Network reference provided in cloud configuration.
- Then `LoadBalancerRouting` object is created with the destination IP information retrieved from the nodes (Note: `LoadBalancerRouting` is internal object to OpenKCM). Later, this information is used at the OpenKCM API level to describe the explicit targets in a pool traffic is routed to.
- OpenKCM supports two types of LoadBalancer `Public` and `Internal`. If LoadBalancer has to be of type Internal, "service.beta.kubernetes.io/OpenKCM-load-balancer-internal" annotation needs to be set to true, otherwise it will be considered as public type.

### Update LoadBalancer

- `UpdateLoadBalancer` gets the `LoadBalancer` and `LoadBalancerRouting` objects based on service name.
- If there is any change in the nodes(added/removed), LoadBalancerRouting destinations are updated.


### Delete LoadBalancer

- EnsureLoadBalancerDeleted gets the LoadBalancer name based on service name, check if it exists and deletes it.

## Managing Routes

The Route Controller within the CCM is specifically tasked with creating and maintaining network routes within the cloud
provider's infrastructure to enable pods on different nodes to communicate. OpenKCM cloud-provider implements below 
interfaces to ensure this functionality.

### Creating Routes

- Create route method retrieve the machine object corresponding to the target node name. 
- Iterates over all target node addresses and identify the matching network interface using internal IPs.
- If a matching network interface is found, proceed with finding prefix. If a prefix already exists, that means the route is already present.
- If the prefix is not found, add it to the network interface specification.

### Deleting Route

- Delete route method retrieves the machine object corresponding to the target node name. 
- Then iterates over all target node addresses and identify the matching network interface using internal IPs.
- If a matching network interface is found, attempt to remove the prefix.
- Check for the prefix in the network interface's spec and remove it if present.

### List Routes

- List route method retrieves all the network interfaces matching the given namespace, network, and cluster label.
- Iterates over each network interface and compiles route information based on its prefixes.
- It also verifies that the network interface is associated with a machine reference and retrieves node addresses based on the machine reference name. 
- Based on all the collected information (Name, DestinationCIDR, TargetNode, TargetNodeAddresses) `Route` list is returned.
