## OpenKCM Review Meetings

### What Are the OpenKCM Review Meetings?

The OpenKCM Review Meeting is a recurring meeting where we review the latest developments in the OpenKCM ecosystem. We discuss recent releases, highlight key changes, and showcase live demos of new features and improvements.

This meeting is open to everyone interested in OpenKCM, from contributors and maintainers to users and community members. We focus on updates relevant to the open-source community while avoiding company-specific details.

### How to Participate

- **Join the Meeting:** Meetings are usually held bi-weekly, typically in the week after a new OpenKCM version is released. If there are many topics, additional meetings may be scheduled.
- **Present a Topic:** If you would like to showcase a feature, bug fix, or any other relevant topic, reach out to us! Each topic should ideally include a short live demo and last 5-10 minutes.


### Recordings & Public Access

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you do not consent to being recorded, please do not enable your microphone or camera, or do not join the meetings.

You can find the recordings and summaries of all previous public community meetings in the [OpenKCM Review Meetings](./review-meetings/_index.md).
